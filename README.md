# VirtualCircuit
### An experiment DSL for logic circuits in Pharo and generating code for FPGAs

## Description
This is the code of an experiment for trying to replicate the work Chisel by
Bachrach et al ([Chisel: Constructing Hardware in a Scala Embedded Language.](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/chisel-dac2012.pdf Chisel paper))
in Pharo.

## Problems and limitations
The main problem of this project is that the Verilog code that is generated by
this DSL can be hard to read, and hard to debug. Another problem with this
project is the lack of facilities for simulating and debug the circuits inside
the Pharo image enviornment.
